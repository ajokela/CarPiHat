# TJD CarPiHAT - The Raspberry Pi Automotive Interface HAT

The TJD CarPiHat has been designed to make interfacing your Raspberry Pi to your car, boat, truck, or any 12V based system much easier. Originally designed to help with my OpenAuto pro installation, demand grew for the board and I have decided to start selling the HAT's.

Currently, the HAT is not open source, although at some point in the future I may explore this option further. 

**PLEASE NOTE:** Whilst I will do my best to support users of the CarPiHAT, I am not a software developer, and I am not able to provide custom software for your application.
